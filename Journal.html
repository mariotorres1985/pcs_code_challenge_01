          <p>In discussing our first week of class retrospectively, our group had no problem coming up with five exciting things to talk about. While we show the items on a numbered list, below, that is not indicative of how we evaluated their importance. A common theme for all three weeks has been the abundance and the quality of tools to which we have been exposed. Our first two item reflect that. Two of the most valuable tools we were introduced to during week on were Git and MAMP.</p>
          <p>The next three items that popped up for discussion were items of particular interest to one or all of us.  We were all quite surprised to discover that Macintosh computers are now commonly used in front-end development.  That has not always been the case.  The kitchen metaphor was an awesome teaching tool that gave us a real-world analogy to help us put web processes into context.  We all very much appreciated its creativity and usefulness.</p>
          <p>Arcy was the driving force behind the parallax discussion.  With his penchant for art, it was an inherently interesting topic.  The discovery of the masterpiece that is the Daft Punk Website, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/">Pitchfork.com</a>, created such awe, we decided to memorialize it with the two images in our first two journal entries.</p>
